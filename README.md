## Looking at bike data

At pycon 2013 in Montreal, Julia Evans gave a [talk](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/talks/blob/master/mtlpy35/pistes-cyclables.ipynb) on using iPython Notebook, pandas, and matplotlib to explore Montreal bike and weather data.  I liked the example-focused style and the exploratory narrative, and I really wish that it was more of a standard.

I'm doing the same thing for data from a minneapolis bike share, and trying to create the same example-focused and exploratory style of narrative for not only basic exporation, but also data munging and visualization.  While a notebook enforces a linear story that you tell with the data, I haven't yet figured out how to tie all of my side experiments together, so everything is very scattered around.
